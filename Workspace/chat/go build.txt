commands : 

go build
On windows machine creates chat.exe if ran in directory

go build -o chat 
creates go binary that can be ran in unix/linux/mac enviroments but not windows if ran in directory 

go get github.com/gorilla/websocket
Needs to be ran locally since I am not going to rehost the package code for this package that the chat application uses

chat.exe -addr=":3000"
Address can be set to IP:PORT as well, running chat.exe by itself defaults to 8080 port on local host
